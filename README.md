##Overview##

###This project is a simple marketplace application built using React, where users can view a list of items, add them to their cart, and rate the products. It also includes functionality to remove items from the cart and ensures that all interactions are reflected in the user interface. The backend is implemented to persist the state in a database, and the project utilizes the T3 stack as a template.###

###Product Listing: Displays a list of products that can be added to the cart.
Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart, and the UI updates to reflect the current cart contents.
Remove from Cart: Users can remove products from their cart, with immediate UI updates.
Product Rating: Users can rate products with a score from 1 to 5.
State Persistence: The application persists state in a database, ensuring data is not lost between sessions.
TypeScript: The project is implemented using TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
